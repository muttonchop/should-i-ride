Motorcycles are a great multi-purpose vehicle. However, there are some worthwhile criticisms when considerating to free yourself from your cage. We try to address them.

# Excuses

## Financial
Purchase, maintence, depreciation, insurance, blah, blah, blah.

## Weather
How often can I ride on my route? What about several of these common trips, how often can I utilize my bike?

## Safety
Bike, experience, age, health, gear, and road conditions all play into how "safe" riding your bike will be.
